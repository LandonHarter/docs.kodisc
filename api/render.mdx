## Example

```typescript TypeScript
const code = `
from manim import *

class ManimScene(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        self.wait(3)
`;

const body = new FormData();
body.append("apiKey", "kodisc_xxxx");
body.append("code", code);
body.append("className", "ManimScene");
body.append("quality", "medium");

const response = await fetch("https://api.kodisc.com/render/video", {
    method: "POST",
    body
});
const json = (await response.json()) as {
    success: boolean;
    error?: string;
    video?: string;
    thumbnail?: string;
};
