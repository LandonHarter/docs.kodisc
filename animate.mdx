## Your Dashboard

When you first log in to Kodisc, you'll be taken to your dashboard. Here, you will have access to all of your projects and account settings. You'll also find many videos made by other Kodisc creators!

## Create a New Project

Go to the projects tab on the sidebar and find the new project button located on the right side of the screen. After clicking, you'll be prompted to choose a "Video" or "Slideshow" project. Don't worry, you can change this after you make your project. The workflow is the exact same for both inside the editor.

Choose a name and description for your project. You can always change this later. Click "Create Project" to get started!

## What is a scene?

Scenes are the building blocks of your animation. You create individual animations within different scenes and combine them when exporting your video. In the case of slideshows, each scene is treated as a slide.

Click the "Create Scene" button to get started. You'll be prompted to name the scene and choose a layout. The layout helps the AI organize your content in a visually appealing way.

For example, if you click the "Center" layout (probably the most common), the AI will try to create a visual at the center of the screen. If you choose the "Vertical" layout, the AI splits the screen down the middle and will place a visual on the left or right, and some other content on the opposite side.

## Rendering your first animation

After creating your scene, find your way to the left side of the screen where the chat is. Every time you send a chat, the AI will generate an animation based on your message. Don't worry, the AI can see all your past messages and is given context on your animation.

Send your first chat! Try to be fairly descriptive. For example, "Show a particle simulation and show how an increase in temperature affects the particles."

<video className="w-full aspect-video rounded-md" src="/videos/particles.mp4" autoPlay muted loop />

And BAM! After a few short seconds, you'll have your first animation. You can always edit the scene by sending another chat. The AI will update the scene based on your new message.
