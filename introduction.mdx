## Who are we?

Kodisc is a platform that allows you to create incredible animations in seconds with AI. Sounds to good to be true, huh? Check out some of our work.

Whether you want to pitch a new idea with a sleek slideshow, teach your students with engaging animations, or love to create content for social media, Kodisc is the perfect tool for you.

## How do we do it?
Kodisc is powered by [Manim](https://manim.community), a code based animation engine created by Grant Sanderson. We've taken the power of Manim and made it accessible to everyone. No coding required!

Grant used Manim to create his popular YouTube channel, [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown), where he teaches complex mathematical concepts with beautiful animations. We want to make it easy for you to create animations like Grant's, without needing to learn how to code.

## What can you do with Kodisc?

Kodisc is perfect for visualizing complex ideas, creating engaging presentations, and making your content stand out on social media.

Are you a teacher? We've helped educators create beautiful and effective videos to teach their students:
- Elementary Algebra
- Integral Calculus
- Chemical Structures
- Electromagnetic Fields
- And more! (We really mean a lot more)
